# Hello-World
This is my first repository 

My name is Paul Frey, I servered 6 years in the U.S. Air Force. I graduated from Hillsborough Comunity College (HCC) with an Associates of Arts in Engineering. I transfered to Saint leo University as a Computer Science major and plan to graduate in 2020. I have found a lot of my classes at Saint Leo very fascinating which has sparked my interest in learning more about C++, Swift, and SQL.
